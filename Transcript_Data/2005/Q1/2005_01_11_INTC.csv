These particular forward-looking statements and all other statements that may be made on this call that are not historical facts  are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our press release for more information on the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ. The specific forward-looking statements cover expectations for product mix and demand, revenue, gross margin, expenses, tax rate, interest and other income, capital spending, depreciation and amortization of acquisition related intangibles, and costs. These statements do not reflect the potential impact of any mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, or other business combinations that may be made after January 10, 2005. Lastly, if during this call we use any non-GAAP financial measure as defined by the SEC and Reg G, you will find on our website, INTC.com, the required reconciliation in the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. I now want to introduce Andy Bryant who will discuss the Fourth Quarter earnings results. Andy?",2
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Thanks, Doug. 2004 was a year of growth. All of our major businesses delivered double digit increases in annual revenues. Total growth approached 14%, a little higher than the growth achieved in 2003. Despite some unfortunate fits and starts, gross margin ended the full year a point higher than 2003 at 58%. And gross margin dollars were up by 16%. Operating and net income were each up by over 30%. The Intel Architecture business grew operating profit by over 16%, while the Communications businesses trimmed their losses slightly. Inventories ended the year up slightly from a year ago, at a fraction of the growth in annual revenue. The ability of the business to generate cash has been consistently high, and we have returned record amounts of cash to stockholders. The quarterly pace as the new year growth rates has inevitably subsided as we look further from the economic trough. It remains healthy at a rate we expect to sustain into the First Quarter. Fourth Quarter revenues was higher than we anticipated in our October earnings release and our December update. (inaudible) by growth in both the Computing and Communications businesses. Exceeding the forecast range of 9.3 to $9.5 billion, revenue of $9.6 billion was over 13% higher than the Third Quarter. This is the highest sequential growth for this period since 1996. The year; to-year quarterly growth was 10%. For the entire year, revenue grew to a record $34.2 billion. Unit shipments were higher than the Third Quarter for Intel Architectural microprocesses, chipsets, and motherboards. In Intel Communications, unit shipments of flash memory were higher as with those of wireless connectivity products. In the Intel Architecture business, revenue of 8.2 billion was up 15% from the Third Quarter, and up 7% from a year ago. Within this segment, microprocessor revenues were $6.8 billion, an increase of almost 15% from the Third Quarter, and almost 5% through the Fourth Quarter of 2003. For the full year, microprocessor revenues grew almost 12%. Most of the rest of the revenue in Intel Architecture business comes from chipsets and motherboards, and grew 18% sequentially, and 21% year; to-year. For the full year, revenue from these products grew 11%. Revenue for Intel's Communication businesses saw excellent year-to; year growth, although the sequential growth rates have slowed. Revenue of $1.4 billion was up 3% from the Third Quarter, and 32% from a year ago. For the full year, revenue for the Communications businesses was up 28%. Within this segment, flash memory generated revenues during the quarter of $643 million, approximately flat with the Third Quarter, and up 61% from a year ago. For the full year, revenue from flash memory was up 42%, to $2.3 billion. Gross margin dollars, up 5.4 billion, were up 14% from the Third Quarter, but down slightly from a year ago. On a percentage basis, gross margin was 56%, in line with our forecast at update. This includes a special year-end employee bonus expense.  We achieved good growth and operating income of $2.9 billion for the quarter, an improvement of 22% over the Third Quarter. As a percentage of revenues, operating income was 30%. In the Intel Architecture business, operating income was 42% of revenue for the quarter at $3.5 billion, representing sequential growth of 25%, and year-to; year quarterly decline of 6%. For the year, the group's operating income was $12.1 billion, up 17% from 2003. The operating loss for the Communications businesses for the quarter was $196 million, an improvement of approximately $54 million from the previous quarter. For 2005, we expect to make substantial progress in profitability. Success will depend on flash pricing and recovery of the communications market, which are difficult to predict. We remain committed to profitability for the Communications group, but we cannot at this time say whether this will happen at the end of 2005 or in 2006. Spending grew during the quarter at a lower rate than revenue. Spending on R&D, marketing, and G& A was on target at $2.4 billion, up 6% sequentially, and up 5% year-to; year. For the year, spending was $9.4 billion, 9% more than 2003, primarily driven by increased spending and product and manufacturing R&D, and other independent expenses. The number of employees grew slightly during the quarter to 85,000 at the end of December, a year-to-year increase of 7%. A total in the Fourth Quarter for interest income, other income, and gains and losses on equity investments, was $127 million, higher than our forecast of 65 million. Within this category of the income statement, interest and other income was $130 million. The effective tax rate for the Fourth Quarter was 29.9%, slightly lower than the 30.5% we anticipated at update. Fully diluted earnings per share, which includes potential dilution attributable to employee stock options, was $.33. Basic earnings per share, which does not include potential dilution, was $.34. Average shares for calculating diluted earnings per share were 6.4 billion. Basic shares outstanding were 6.3 billion, down 1% from the Third Quarter, and 3% from a year ago. During the quarter, we repurchased 89 million shares at a cost of $2 billion. On the balance sheet, inventories were lower in raw materials, work in process, and finished goods, adding up to total decrease of $559 million, or 18%. This decrease is larger than we anticipated at update in December, as a result of revenues that was higher than anticipated. On a product basis, inventory declined in all Intel Architecture categories, and in flash memory and wireless connectivity. The current level of $2.6 billion is a little lower than we would consider optimal. Cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets ended the quarter at $16.8 billion, an increase from Third Quarter of $1 billion, after stock repurchases of 2 billion, capital spending of 1 billion, and dividend payments of $252 million. As we turn now to the outlook for the First Quarter, please keep in mind that the forecast data do not include the effect of any new acquisitions or divestitures that may be completed after January 10th. Nor do they include the effect of new accounting standards for share-based compensations. I will use the midpoint of forecast ranges in making comparisons to prior periods. We are planning for sequential decline and sustained year; to-year growth in the First Quarter, with revenue between 8.8 and $9.4 billion. The midpoint of this range would be down 5% from the Fourth Quarter, consistent with historical trends from the fourth to the First Quarter. Compared to the First Quarter of 2004, the midpoint of the forecast revenue range would be an increase of approximately 12%. Our target for gross margin percentage in the First Quarter is 55%, plus or minus a couple of points. This is 1 point less than the Fourth Quarter. Factory utilization will be higher in the First Quarter and will boost gross margins, but the benefit will be offset by higher start up costs in the factories, which I will discuss shortly, and lower revenues. The forecast is 5 points lower than gross margins in the First Quarter of 2004.  Spending, R&D plus MG&A, should be approximately $2.5 to $2.6 billion. Depreciation should be $1.2 billion, plus or minus $100 million. We expect amortization of acquisition related intangibles for Q1 to be approximately $40 million. Our estimate for gains and losses from equity investments and interest and other income is a net gain of $100 million. Looking ahead to the entire year, we expect gross margin percentage for 2005 to be approximately 58%, plus or minus a few points. The midpoint would be roughly flat with 2004. Higher start-up costs and other items related to the ramp of the new 65nm processor will be concentrated in the first half of the year, with similar impact in the first and Second Quarters. We expect that during this period, the cost of these investments will offset the operating benefits of higher unit volumes and higher factory utilization. In the second half, start-up costs should decline. If over the year, the business progresses according to typical seasonal patterns and start-up costs decline as planned, we will expect gross margin percentage to be higher in the third and Fourth Quarter than in the first and second. The emphasis in capital spending continues to shift to smaller geometries, with the focus now on 65nms. We are targeting capital spending at $5.1 billion, plus or minus $200 million. This is higher than the 3.8 billion spent in 2004. Most of the projected $1.3 billion increase in the budget will be spent to ramp the passing on our new 65nm processors, in 300 millimeter factories. 90% of spending for battery equipment this year is targeted at 65nm. For research and development in 2005, we plan to spend $5.2 billion on R&D, an increase from the $4.8 billion we spent in 2004. Most of the increase in the budget will be directed to product development and validation for Intel Architecture products. $5.2 billion is the highest level of R&D spending in Intel's history. Depreciation for 2005 is expected to be approximately $4.4 billion for the year, plus or minus $100 million, which would be slightly below $4.6 billion in 2004. Although the pace of change is slow, this would mark the third year of lower depreciation. Our estimated tax rate for 2005 is 31%. I would like to close with a look back at 2004, and a list of what I see as some of our most significant financial accomplishments. Growth and total revenue approaching 14%, on top of growth that approached 13% in 2003. Growth in microprocessor sales of 12%, following 17% growth in 2003. Relative revenue from Communication businesses of 28%, including 42% in flash memory. 18 consecutive years and 72 consecutive quarters of profitability. Operating income of $10.1 billion, up 34% from 2003. Gross margin dollars up 16% from 2003. Another year of discipline on spending. Discretionary spending grew at a slower rate than revenue, and the Q4 level was actually less than Q4 of 2003. Discretionary spending per person grew at half the rate of revenue. Spending for R&D, marketing, and G&A grew at a slower rate in the business. As a percentage of revenues, spending was down slightly for the quarter and for the year as a whole. Outstanding credit controls maintained as we expanded into emerging markets, where open credit terms are less common. Bad debts were the lowest in five years, and quarterly days outstanding range from 36 to 34 days, and ended the year at 34. Capital spending of $3.8 billion. With 300 millimeter we spent over $1 billion less on bad capacity, than would have been required with the equivalent capability on the older 200 millimeter process. Total savings from the 300 millimeter program to date totalled $4 billion, with the plans for continued savings in 2005. R&D of $4.8 million, for a total of $13.2 billion over the last three years.  49 consecutive quarters of cash dividend payments with $1 billion paid in 2004, bringing the cumulative distribution of stockholders to $4.3 billion. The announcement of two doublings of dividends in roughly $2 billion of payments in 2005. $7.5 million in stock repurchases, twice as much as $4 billion spent in 2003. This brings the cumulative number of shares repurchased since the buyback program began in 1990, to 2.2 billion. Decline in annual basic shares outstanding of 2%. From its quarterly peak in 1998, basic shares in Q4 are down 7%. An increase of nearly $1 billion in cash, short-term investments, and fixed income trading assets. And, finally, cash from operations of approximately $13 billion. For each of the preceding eight years Intel has generated over $8 billion in cash. With that, let me turn it over for Paul for comment on the business.",3
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," Thanks, Andy. As Andy mentioned, Intel achieved record quarterly and annual revenue, driven by strength in all of our Intel Architecture groups across all geographies and channels. On a geographic basis, our Asia Pacific region continued to set new records and was up 10% versus the Third Quarter, and 27% versus the year ago. APAC continues to benefit from strong local consumption in both business and consumer, as well as export pro [ph]. China set another revenue record and grew 26% for the full year. In India, we continued to see a rapidly growing PC market with our business there growing about 45% for the year. IMEA [ph] had our highest sequential growth, up 21% versus the Third Quarter, benefiting from strength in both consumer and business, especially for notebooks. The region had particularly strong emerging market growth in the Middle East and central Europe. In the Americas regions, revenue is up 14% sequentially, better than seasonally normal, thanks to U.S. retail sales, which had good up-take of mobile products, along with enterprise strength and a bounce-back following CPU inventory depletion by some of our OEM customers in the Third Quarter. In Latin America, an improving macroeconomic environment helped us set new revenue records for both the quarter and the year. In Japan, we had records for the quarter and the full year surpassing a mark set four years ago. Revenue was up 10% sequentially, and 9% versus a year ago, thanks to seasonal growth in local consumption and a continued strength in notebook exports. Our channel business continues to be a key source of growth worldwide, setting new records in both units and revenues. Our channel business was particularly strong in emerging markets driven by consumer, government, and small-business purchase of PCs. Earlier this year we outlined a goal to double our coverage of emerging market cities, via our distribution channel. We met that goal and now have a presence in over 1,200 cities in 110 countries worldwide. Moving to the Intel Architecture business, the mobile group had another very strong quarter with record units and revenue. Mobile units grew over 50% versus the same period last year, as notebook processors continued to gain as a percentage of our processor shipments for PCs, growing at the rate of a couple of percentage points a quarter. We saw strong Centrino demand from consumers in the holiday season, especially in established markets such as the U.S., where notebooks reached nearly 1/2 of retail PC unit sales. During the quarter we also began shipping the Alviso chipset in preparation for next week's launch of our new mobile platform, code name Sonoma. Sonoma is the next generation Intel Centrino mobile technology platform, and includes a  Devon [ph] Pentium M processor with a faster front side bus, integrated 80211AB and G Wi-Fi capability, and the Alviso chipset which supports improved integrated graphics, Intel High Definition audio, PCI express, and DDR2 memory. Our desktop business also had a strong quarter, with double-digit sequential unit growth and a strong mix to Pentium processors. Our hyper-threading technology continues to grow, and now represents 2/3 of our performance shipments, providing further foundation for the rollout of our dual core processors later this year. Last week we began shipping our new 600 sequence Pentium processors, featuring a 2 megabyte cache that will be in OEM systems later this quarter. In the digital home, the Fourth Quarter saw entertainment PCs become a reality, with over 20 products now introduced based on the Pentium 4 processor with HT Technology, and the Intel 915 Express Chipset. Entertainment PCs combine the functionality of multiple consumer electronic devices, such as DVD players, gaming stations, and personal video recorders into a single platform that also supports web consent browsing and home networking. Our Enterprise group had another record quarter for unit and revenue led by strong demand for the recently introduced 64 bit Intel Xeon processor platform for DP servers and workstations, which supports PCI express, DDR2 memory and 64-bit extensions. Shipments of this product more than tripled in the Fourth Quarter to over 1 million units, becoming our fastest ramping Xeon chip ever in this first 2 quarters of shipment . We also enhanced our Itanium 2 processor line up, with 6 new processors spanning multi-processor, dual-processor, and low voltage system designs. In the latest top 500 ranking, Intel powers over 60% of the world's fastest super computers, a 15-fold increase over the past three years. Itanium based systems make up 83 super computers at the top 500 list, including NASA's project Columbia system, the second fastest in the world. Lastly in microprocessors, we demonstrated 3 next generation dual core microprocessors during the quarter for server, desktop, and notebook market segments, including our first 65nm dual core processor, code name Yonah. Our chipset business set unit and revenue records as it maintained our attach rate at the high level reached in the Third Quarter, up substantially up from the beginning of the year. In particular, we saw increasing demand for our grand sale chipset which experienced sequential growth of approximately 40%, helping us exit the year at nearly half of our performance chipset shipments, with particular strength from large OEMs. Motherboard unit shipments also set a new record in the quarter, and were up over 50% for the full year. Moving to our Communications group, ICG saw revenue up 3% sequentially, and up 32% versus a year ago. Our flash revenue was flat sequentially, as higher units were offset by lower ASPs due to pricing pressure in both the cellular and broad markets. For the full year, our flash business grew over 40%, led by good demand for our latest Strata flash products for handsets. It allowed us to recapture the number 1 position in the Nor [ph] market segment in the second half of the year. The fastest growing portion of our Communications business continues to be wireless LAN, a key component of our Centrino mobile technology platform. Units were up 30% sequentially, and more than doubled versus last year. We also began shipping our ABG solution in support of the upcoming Sonoma launch. Our Applications processor business also saw good growth in the quarter, thanks to the ramp of exciting new products like the Palm Treo 650, which features our latest XScale microprocessor. In summary, we ended 2004 with record revenue for the quarter and the year, as well as strong growth in profits. Our investments in platform innovation and global presence help drive continued growth in the emerging markets, rapid notebook adoption in established markets, and record shipments for our enterprise products. Our investments in 300-millimeter and 90nm capacity allowed us to make a major transition to new products that meets considerable upside from robust PC demand this past quarter. We've also made substantial progress on 65nm technology, which will allow us to cost effectively ramp dual core microprocessors across all of the compelling segments beginning later this year.  Finally, we have made significant progress in our ability to deliver platform value in new ways, as evidenced by the momentum of our Centrino mobile technology and new chipsets that bring major advances in audio, video, graphics, memory, and IO. In 2005 we anticipate another year of solid growth, driven by our new Sonoma platform for mobility and forthcoming processors and platforms for the enterprise, digital office, and digital home. With that, I'll turn it back to Doug to begin Q and A.",4
Doug Lusk, Director of Investor Relations," Okay, thanks, Paul. We will now open the conference call for Q and A. We will attempt to take questions from as many participants as possible. To help in this process, we ask that you please limit yourself to only 1 question, and no more than 1 brief follow-up. Thank you. Operator?",5
Questions And Answers,Questions And Answers,Questions And Answers,Questions And Answers
Operator,Operator, (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from Tim Luke with Lehman Brothers.,6
Tim Luke, Analyst," Thanks very much. Congratulations on the quarter. I was wondering in being up 15% sequentially in the process arena, Andy, in the past you had alluded to the fact that you were monitoring any issues associated with double ordering. Could you give us a sense of how you view that and how you view that with respect to your guide for the First Quarter bouncing the extra week that you have in the First Quarter, with how you see the normal seasonality of the beginning of the year. Thank you.",7
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Sure, whenever you're in a tight situation, being customer orders, you always worry about double ordering. There are a few ways we can check on it. We can look at the channel, which we have pretty good insight into what's out and actually in the inventory and it's actually a little less than it was in the Third Quarter. You can look at your customers' demand and the urgency in which they're expediting you. Right now it doesn't feel like there is extra shipping going on. I can't comment on whether there are extra orders or not. So it doesn't feel like anything terribly unusual happened in Q4. As far as looking forward to Q1, the midpoint of the revenue range would be down 5%. That is kind of what you expect seasonally. We do have the extra week in there so I think I --we'll get some benefit from that. It's hard to know exactly how much. So I would tend to say what we forecasted for the First Quarter is a little higher drop than you'd seasonally see, but inside the range we historically see. Mostly because of coming out with a pretty strong Q4, we looked at year-over-year growth of 12% in revenue and felt like that was a pretty comfortable place to be.",8
Tim Luke, Analyst," Then with respect to your First Quarter where you talked about utilization improving, could you just reconcile how we should proceed the start-up costs spread across the First Quarter and Second Quarter and how that may impact gross margins at the beginning of the year. ",9
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Sure, that's a--I'm going to go into a essentially a second speech now, so I'll eventually get to your question. If you look at my--let me start with my Fourth Quarter. If you look at the Fourth Quarter, we saw a billion dollars more in revenue and margin percentage was essentially flat. If you look at that revenue growth mostly being Intel Architecture, you would expect to see at least a couple points or margin expansion, all things being equal. The reason it was flat, is because we have 2 to 3 points worth of expenses in the start-up costs and under utilization costs in the Fourth Quarter. So think in terms of in the Fourth Quarter, I'm starting on 2 or 3 points for start-up and utilization which kept the margin percentage flat. As I move into Q1, I get back the end utilization charges. So we don't have any under utilization costs in the First Quarter, or we have minimum, none in Intel Architecture. However, my start-up costs increase again, so the net effect of those 2, some good news out of utilization, some bad news on our start-up costs, pushes the margin down by about 1 point, the 1 point drop you see. I would expect the same--approximately the same level of start-up costs in the Second Quarter, and then we start to see it drop off a fair amount in the third and Fourth Quarter.",10
Tim Luke, Analyst, Thank you.,11
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from John Lau with Banc of America.,12
John Lau, Analyst," Great. Thank you. You made a lot of progress with regards to the inventory reduction. I was wondering, 2 questions, was there any write-downs that you had taken with regards to that inventory reduction and I have a follow-up. Thank you.",13
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Not really. When you tend to have 'write-downs' or the reevaluations or whatever somebody thinks is going on, is when inventories--when costs are going down. So if factories are ramping, costing is going down, any inventory that's left over from the prior quarter gets adjusted. If you look at the way--where we are right now, the cost of a microprocessor in the third and Fourth Quarter are approximately the same. So no inventory reevaluations. The other thing you should look at is the date of inventory. I have about $2.5 of inventory which is 45 or 50 days worth of inventory, so I have very little in inventory now that was in inventory at the end of the Third Quarter. Again, I don't have much I can even talk about as being revalued. Simple answer, nearly all the decrease is we shipped out more than we expected and we decreased our wafer starts like we said in the Third Quarter, so we built less than we would have previously.",14
John Lau, Analyst, You mentioned with regards to the inventory now you're a little bit leaner than you wanted. I was wondering if you could follow-up on that and if you can give us any color as to whether there was any product constraints as a result of this significantly lower inventory level. Thank you. ,15
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Sure. We have some customers who wished we could have shipped a little more to them in the Fourth Quarter. So that is the tightness I talked about earlier. My personal opinion is we did try to slam the door hard on inventory. We probably went a little too far. If you ask me today, sure, I wish we had another $100 million worth of (inaudible) products available to ship. It is not an emergency to increase inventory, but it won't bother me at all. In fact, I would like to see us get a little bit more in the first and Second Quarter.",16
John Lau, Analyst," Great progress. Thank you, very much.",17
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Chris Danely with J.P. Morgan.,18
Chris Danely, Analyst," Hey, guys, thanks. Just another quick question on the gross margin. So as we trend throughout the year to get to the 58%, you mentioned that there is some more start-up costs in Q2. I guess in getting to your assumptions, are you guys taking into account that Q2 could be a little bit weaker than seasonal because of the extra week in Q1? And also, in the second half of the year, to get to the 58% for the year, do you assume that we can see the kind of incremental gross margin ramp like we saw in the second half of '03?",19
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Okay, so let me start with the second one. Certainly we assume revenue ramp in the second half, kind of seasonal, which I believe should lead to some margin expansion possibility on the basic business. I would also expect to see some benefit from lower start-up costs. It takes both of those to get my 58% for the year. In terms of the extra week, you got to be real careful when you think about how that affects gross margin in the First Quarter. Remember the way accounting works is in that extra week you build product and you spend money to build product. You don't expense that extra week. It basically goes to inventory and then gets recognized at cost when that product ships. So the extra week in and of itself doesn't add a big bunch of cost in the First Quarter. The piece that it does add into, is like the start-up cost. The cost of of the period cost that goes straight to the bottom line, that you have one more week's worth of those in the First Quarter. So what you should think of as the extra week is adding or decreasing margins a little bit, but not a lot.",20
Chris Danely, Analyst," Okay. Then on the inventory, can you give us a rough idea of where you'd like your inventory to be either in terms of dollars or days going into the second half of the year?",21
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," I probably would leave that one alone. Inventory is hard to forecast, but, again, where we are today I think we got too thin. You know, the business expanded over the last year by almost 14%, my inventory went up 3 or 4 points, I thought I was pretty good in control of last year. So yes, I would like to see the inventory to be up. I'd like to make sure I can  meet my customers' needs. In this business, not being able to fill an order is a much bigger problem than having inventory sit around for an extra few days.",22
Chris Danely, Analyst," I'm sorry, Andy, just a quick clarification on your first answer. So you guys had over 100% incremental gross margin in the second half of '03, is that what you need to get to the 58% gross margin for the year? Thanks.",23
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," I'm not going to get in that fine a level of detail, but I've given you a pretty good idea of how much start-up costs are affecting margins in the first and Second Quarter. I get a big percentage of that back in the third and Fourth Quarter, and I do need to get some incremental margins out of revenue expansion to make it work.",24
Chris Danely, Analyst," Okay. That's fine. Thanks, guys. Sorry about the long winded question.",25
Operator,Operator, Next question comes from Tom Thornhill from USB.,26
Tom Thornhill, Analyst," Can we move up to a couple more macro questions, maybe more towards Paul on this side. If you look at the environment in the corporate market, what are you seeing there in terms of IT spending trends, capital spending trends, because we have been little CapEx as a percent of capability is a little low relative to where it could be.",27
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," You're right. I think that I tried to put that in some of my comments, Tom. In general, if you look at the product line as it did well in the second half of this year, particularly in the Fourth Quarter, servers continued to have quarterly records and set all-time records in the Fourth Quarter, our server chips. And I said in desktops and notebooks, which are principally--notebooks are principally business machines, we saw strong numbers in both of those. Records in notebooks, for example. So if we look at that, our view is that business is expanding, in terms of IT purchases, people are making the trade-off of increasing their CapEx as a savings of OPEX, in terms of driving productivity and driving just IT costs down from servicing old equipment and so forth. I believe that trend will continue in 2005. We see no--we see nothing on the horizon that would stop that and I think that is the one thing that kept us going over the course of this year. In addition to that, what I think gave Q4 a nice boost was the retail and consumer purchases. Christmas was very, very good across the globe.",28
Tom Thornhill, Analyst," One follow-up on the corporate side. Are there some specific programs coming up that you think would accelerate corporate purchasing such as active management, windows that start to roll across the product line and do you expect  that to have a material impact?",29
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," It rolls into our client line in the mid-this year, and we'll be making that available to our sales force in terms of how to sell it and when to sell it, probably in the next couple of weeks or so. But you'll start seeing an advocacy for that. I don't think that alone will drive a sea change. That just makes--makes it even more sweet to swap out old equipment for new.",30
Tom Thornhill, Analyst, Thanks.,31
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Mark Edelstone with Morgan Stanley.,32
Mark Edelstone, Analyst," Good afternoon, guys. First question is probably for Paul. Obviously very good growth in both processors and in the support products, the chipsets and motherboards. And in the Fourth Quarter it's historically been somewhat unusual to see faster growth in the chipsets and motherboards, vis-a-vis processors and that happened here this quarter to the tune of few hundred basis points. Can you talk about the dynamics that drove that in the quarter and what the implications of that look to be from your perspective.",33
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," I think there is 2 things there, Mark. One is that we believe we gained some market segment share in chipsets than we have over the course of the year. That's why I talked about the attach rate to our microprocessors increasing substantially over the 4 quarters. Number one. Number two, as notebooks grow more rapidly than desktops, we actually--we have a much nicer position in notebook chipsets than desktop chipsets. So you'll see an acceleration as a result of that. Both of those worked in our advantage in the Fourth Quarter.",34
Mark Edelstone, Analyst," And just a clarification from Andy. Andy, you talked about the benefit based or the cost, rather, in gross margins in Q4 of 2 to 3 points coming from start-up costs and under utilization charges. Can you just give us a sense of what percentage of that 2 or 3 points came from, the start-up costs?",35
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Let's see, I won't give you that much. I will tell you that under utilization charges were more than 50% of those points, yes.",36
Mark Edelstone, Analyst," Okay. Thanks a lot, guys. ",37
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP", It was close. It wasn't--it's not vastly different one from the other.,38
Mark Edelstone, Analyst, Thanks a lot.,39
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Michael Masdea with CSFB.,40
Michael Masdea, Analyst," Thanks a lot. If you think back to kind of your transitions from products, especially gone on the desktop side and then you think about the dual core pricing. How is that shaking out? Is that going to be similar to past parts transitions or are you looking for substantially higher premiums?",41
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," I think we will--it depends on what product you're talking about and when, Michael. But in general, I think you'll see us bring it in at the high end of the product line probably as an enthusiast product initially and then drive it down over time as the costs come down on 65nms on the desktop. In notebooks the first dual core product we launch is on 65nm so we've got a very good cost structure. So I think you'll see us drive that even more aggressively from the start.",42
Michael Masdea, Analyst," Okay, and I guess from the CapEx side, Andy, assuming that things are wildly out of whack in terms of the PC market this year, how much can you flex that CapEx or do you feel like more or less it will come from out in that range.",43
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," It won't flex too much, Michael. What you have to recognize is the vast majority of this increase is going into 65nm, which is beginning production this year, and so the start-up costs in the first half kind of tie to that, the capital will kind of tie to that. And recognize this is driving the technology treadmill, it is getting better performing products, it's getting lower costs. Most of the benefit from this actually occurs in '06 and '07. So as is typically the case, every other year you will see a spike in capital, you will see a spike for the equipment for the next generation. And that's what this is. It was--given our basic belief that technology, leadership wins, it would take a lot to move us off this number.",44
Michael Masdea, Analyst, Does that mean we're trending down in '06 and '07 in CapEx?,45
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Oh, my God. Actually, I'll update my capital efficiency chart, and you'll probably get some idea where we're headed. ",46
Michael Masdea, Analyst, Thanks a lot.,47
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Andrew Root with Goldman Sachs.,48
Andrew Root, Analyst," Thanks, just a couple quick questions. The first is if you think about the PC unit growth for '05, just wondering as you think about how you manage production last year, and there was some fits and starts as you mentioned, Andy. Are you going to manage sort of to a target to whatever your expectations are for PC unit gross for the year and sort of take a little bit more swing in inventory and a little less swing in gross margin? How can that change? I'm just curious how you think it all plays out.",49
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," Let me try and take this one, Andrew. Our modelling profile is assuming that we see double digit growth again in the PC unit scenario. We're not forecasting that. We're just planning around that in terms of being able to have sufficient capacity. As Andy indicated, it's in our best interest economically and customer wise to satisfy every order that comes at us. So we want to be a little bit long in making sure that we have the ability to satisfy those orders. At the same time we do that, we're going to be very cognizant of what happened in inventory last year and what were the causes behind it and try to keep a tighter control on the various leavers. Having a healthier set of products as we enter '05 versus '04 gives us a lot more granularity and ability to control than we did in '05--than we did last year.",50
Andrew Root, Analyst," Okay. That makes sense. Then just following up on pricing in the Fourth Quarter. Flat microprocessor pricing--a little surprising because (inaudible) better. Was the consumer the offset or were you tougher on pricing for your competitive reasons, or was there a little bit bigger drop in the stack than you expected?",51
Paul Otellini," President,  COO", Actually I was kind of happy that it was flattish.,52
Andrew Root, Analyst, Okay.,53
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," If you remember in October we were concerned about our pricing pressure being on margin, so it actually turned out better than we expected.",54
Andrew Root, Analyst,  Okay. Thank you.,55
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Prudential.,56
Mark Lipacis, Analyst," Great. Andy, can you talk about--how should we think about operating expenses for 2005? Thank you.",57
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Sure, as a general rule we talked about R&D and you saw the growth there. What we would tend to do is probably grow the other expenses along the same lines, the mix is pretty reasonable. Always R&D comes first here, if business stays healthy you can see all the operating expenses growing in similar type ranges.",58
Mark Lipacis, Analyst, Great. Thank you.,59
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Adam Parker with Sanford Bernstein.,60
Adam Parker, Analyst," Yes, hello. With your plans to invest I guess $10.3 billion in CapEx plus R&D this year, I'm just trying to think about how you evaluate your ultimate return on that investment, I mean, if I look at changes in your net operating profit versus changes in the capital over the next few years, would I expect that to increase? I guess what I'm wondering is how do you justify that kind of spending and how do you think about reaping its benefits. You mentioned a couple years out, but can you qualify that more?",61
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," It will be hard for me to give you the answer you're looking for, Adam. We do on all of these investments an ROI and we look at what we think the future cash flows will be versus doing investment versus not doing the investment. When I started working with Craig years ago, who tried to slow down the rate of technology, because I thought it didn't get the return, because we didn't use it long enough, and he gave me the assignment to go off and do the analysis and lo and behold the benefit you get from lower costs of the product plus the better performing product and the ability to protect your price stack, it is an enormous return. So we still do that for each new generation. We do that for each new factory. And what I can tell you, the returns on these investments are well above our weight average cost of capital.",62
Adam Parker, Analyst," Interesting you mentioned that--if you look I think a couple years ago in 2003, Intel got a lot of credit for so called investing through the downturn. And I guess I'm wondering, did we already see all the benefits of that investment? In  other words, the 9.2 billion in CapEx you spent during those peak 4 quarters.",63
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Oh, no. You have not yet seen all the return for those. Again, remember how we waterfall the capital equipment. So today chipsets are still built on the 200-millimeter network. Those will still move into that 300-millimeter network and take advantage of the cost that come from that and the new technology that comes from being on more advanced processes. So with the waterfalling program we have, once the chipsets get through those, another product will come through those processes. We can extend the life of those factories and most of that equipment for well beyond the '2 years' that it would takes to turn it over because it water falls to another product line.",64
Adam Parker, Analyst, All right. One last follow-up. Sorry. Is your delta notepad over delta capital employed going up over the next five years? Because you sort of said that you do this analysis. If it turns out that it has gotten worse over the last few years. I agree it is way above your cost of capital. I'm just trying to understand what the plan or the direction or the trend or return of that return metric that you guys use.,65
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP", I haven't done the math and I don't want to make it up on the spot. I'll go look at that and when we see you guys in the next quarter or so we can talk about it.,66
Adam Parker, Analyst," Okay. Cool, thanks.",67
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Glenn Young with Smith Barney.,68
Glenn Young, Analyst," Thanks. You know, just sticking with the CapEx question, I wonder if you can give us a break down in your CapEx (inaudible; microphone inaccessible).",69
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Historically we've been a third bricks and mortar, a third equivalent going into the factories and third off of all other, engineering labs, and things like that. If you take that as our historical third baseline and then you take the increase and put most of it--most of it, not all of it--into equipment, you get a pretty good split. So it will be more heavily allocated into equivalent for fab in '05.",70
Glenn Young, Analyst,"  (inaudible; microphone inaccessible) on your back end utilization range, both sort of internally and externally, how do you think that is, as we go into the First Quarter?",71
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," I think if you look at not only the back end or front end right now, the manufacturing capabilities is pretty fully utilized. We're certainly--one of the things we're trying to do is make sure we have capability in the back end to satisfy the need. The area we were short first in the Fourth Quarter, and later in the Fourth Quarter, I wish I had more dye as well. So again, we're trying to make sure we have the capacity available every place. Right now the factory is very busy.",72
Glenn Young, Analyst," That is one clarification and an answer you gave earlier, you talked about your guidance, your expectations for First Quarter revenues, based on lower than what we might normally see sequentially because you felt like your year-over-year at 12% was somewhere you are comfortable with. Given that your inventories are low, are there any signs from customers that you are actually seeing explicitly tells you that you are sequentially lower than normal?",73
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP", No.,74
Glenn Young, Analyst, Thanks.,75
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Apjit Walia with RBC.,76
Apjit Walia, Analyst," Thanks, great quarter, guys. The question I had is in terms of your current trend, you obviously seen above seasonal trend for Q4, and you got it relatively in line with seasonality with Q1, now you guys typically lead the cycle on the way up and the way down, there seems to be disconnect with what you're seeing and what that majority of semi companies are seeing for Q4 and Q1, I believe. Can you explain the disconnect here in terms of your demand and what everybody else is seeing.",77
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," The target we reconcile my in demand to theirs. I think the PC space is having a pretty good--had a pretty good Fourth Quarter. I don't see how that--well, again, we've given it outlook for the Q1 that's kind of seasonal off of that good Fourth Quarter and I can't explain other people's business very well.",78
Apjit Walia, Analyst,"  Right. In terms of units, you've given the margin guidance for '05, when do you think units could blossom and could you give some sort of a unit assumption for '05?",79
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," As Paul said, we don't forecast the PC marketplace for the year. Our internal planning is, I think you said 10% double digit, to make sure we can support the market if it grows at that rate. Typically--",80
Paul Otellini," President,  COO", Typical pattern is the first half of the year is below the peak--prior Fourth Quarter and then you get sequential growth in Q3 and Q4. Right now that's what we're guiding you towards and that's what we've built into our financial assumption.,81
Apjit Walia, Analyst," Great. And one clarification, is there some sort of a shift in seasonality in terms of with India, with the First Quarter in India being stronger than typical and then New York coming in early and China. Do you think there is some seasonal shift changing especially with Asia becoming more relevant in demand?",82
Paul Otellini," President,  COO", Not really.,83
Apjit Walia, Analyst, Okay. Thank you.,84
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Michael Mcconnell with Pacific Crest Securities.,85
Michael Mcconnell, Analyst," Thank you. Question is actually for Paul on the flash front. Your competitor yesterday had some difficulty on the flash--on their flash revenues. I was curious what pricing is like, what you're seeing in that segment. And more importantly, demand, really from from an industry perspective.",86
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," Well as I said, we had unit growth sequentially from Q3 to Q4, and it was all in revenue is about flat and it was offset by pricing pressure. If I were to kind of take 2 slices of the flash market in which we participate, it's--there is the cellular market and there is the broad market, and the pricing in the broad market segment was a bit more brutal than it was in the cellular market where the products are designed in and we have contracts and certainly competitive, but it is not nearly as real-time competitive as you see in the broad market. ",87
Michael Mcconnell, Analyst," Okay. Great. Then 1 more question for you, Paul, as well. Could you just--you talked about retail sales being very good across the board. How are they specifically in North America?",88
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," I think I gave a specific comment on North America in the commentary but they were good. They were particularly good if you count the direct sales to consumers. As we look at this thing, we look at both retail and the portion of our output is likely to go to consumers through direct channels. The combination of those 2 in North America we think was a very strong consumer quarter.",89
Michael Mcconnell, Analyst," Thank you, very much.",90
Operator,Operator, Your text question comes from Charlie Glavin with Needham & Company.,91
Charlie Glavin, Analyst," Thanks. Actually Andy, a quick housekeeping in terms of the one-time tax pass-through from the repatriation, can you give a little more clarity on that, and did that influence any additional spending from the CapEx from the follow-up.",92
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Sure, at this point we--the IRS and Treasury Department haven't published the final rules, yet. So we're kind of on hold to make sure were understand the rules from the government so that we can optimize inside that program. As a result, it has not influenced any programs yet because we don't know what does or doesn't count.",93
Charlie Glavin, Analyst," Then, Paul, if I could, you mentioned about your plans last year as far as upping the channel support in the emerging regions. Exiting out the year and going into '05, how much of that will shift towards more the EPSC, more the enterprise efforts as opposed to some of the desktop and notebook efforts that you had in '04?",94
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," Well, as we expand the channels, we try to put the whole breadth of the product line into each new distribution point. It is a little harder when you get to countries like Nigeria and Iraq. We're operating now with some of these channel partners, but the demand for low-end servers certainly is there and we'll supply that through EPSC. The whitebook business, that is, the channel notebook business, is also growing nicely in the incremental cities we brought on. I am not comfortable giving you the share of our server chips that go out to the channel but it is a non-trivial amount. It is a fairly large chunk of the business. ",95
Charlie Glavin, Analyst," Paul, if I could then, can can you give a rough estimate in terms of the employees who seem to recall out of Oregon that you guys are approaching almost 10,000 employees that are really supporting that channel effort directly or indirectly including wills [ph] software efforts. Is that a right way of looking at this?",96
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," No, I don't--10,000 Intel employees supporting our channel business?",97
Charlie Glavin, Analyst, Directly and indirectly including your partners?,98
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," Well, oh, if you count the number of sales people, I mean we have 165,000 authorized dealers, at least 165,000 people.",99
Charlie Glavin, Analyst, Okay.,100
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," I mean, I wouldn't even begin to figure out what the number is. At one point in time I calculated there were over a million people selling our products but that was a couple of years ago.",101
Charlie Glavin, Analyst, Okay. Got it. Thanks.,102
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Kevin Rottinghaus with Midwest Research.,103
Kevin Rottinghaus, Analyst, Thanks. Any indications on finished product levels finishing the year and coming out of the holidays?,104
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," You're asking our customers? Do our customers have inventory build, is that the question?",105
Kevin Rottinghaus, Analyst,"  They're also out in the channel, so boards are finished PCs out in the channel overall.",106
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP", None that we can identify. The better people to ask is our customers and what their inventory situations look like. In a channel there doesn't seem to be a build.,107
Kevin Rottinghaus, Analyst," Okay. Then on the 65nm ramp, do you have targets, or have you announced any targets at what percentage shipments will be on 65 at year-end and when you start to ship for revenue in 65?",108
Paul Otellini," President,  COO", What we said is that we will ship for revenue products off of that process in 2005 and have not gotten more granular than that.,109
Kevin Rottinghaus, Analyst, Okay.,110
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," And we've demonstrated one of those chips, already.",111
Kevin Rottinghaus, Analyst," Okay. And I guess the last question, any benefit this quarter, you talked about an inventory build to OEMs, can you quantify at all what kind of benefit that might have had for you inside this quarter versus what percentage of the 15% was actual real demand?",112
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," It was all real demand. I think what I commented on was that into the end of the Third Quarter if you recall we were a little disappointed versus the final result, because we had had some cancellations towards the end of the quarter from some of our largest customers who were trying to keep their inventories very thin. We did not see that this quarter. So I think I am quite certain that what was purchased this quarter went for builds. People aren't sitting on our parts. They're--it's just too costly.",113
Kevin Rottinghaus, Analyst, Okay. Thank you.,114
Doug Lusk, Director of Investor Relations," Operator we'll take 2 more questions, please. ",115
Operator,Operator, Your next question comes from Cody Acree with Legg Mason.,116
Cody Acree, Analyst," Thanks. As you push through 2005 and begin to ramp dual core and volume, what impact could we expect maybe in the second half of the year, maybe even then going into 2006 to utilization rates and fab loadings, as that begins to be a bigger piece of revenue.",117
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," I don't think you'll see anything unusual. As Paul said before, for this particular year, there is no change to our lowering capacity plan for dual core next year we'll have the product on the same treadmill we have every other product which is increasingly smaller. Taking advantage of 65nms. I actually have said I think that the price of the--the cost of the product will continue down as we ramp new technologies and ramp into new products.",118
Cody Acree, Analyst, And can you just give a quick level set on what your changes recently have been in the road map for dual core introductions?,119
Paul Otellini," President,  COO"," Well, there have been no changes from the last update which I believe was at the analysts meeting and that meeting we identified 3 dual-core products shipping next year, one for server, one for desktop and one for notebook. I plotted out the exit rate for '05 and '06 and the percentage of each of those businesses as dual core as a fraction of our shipment. I don't remember the numbers off the top of my head but they have not changed from that update.",120
Cody Acree, Analyst," Okay. Great. And lastly, Andy, you said that demand obviously was a little higher than you expected. Were you able to ship and sell any of the inventory that you previously needed to write down?",121
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," Boy, there is no increased to margin for selling previously reserved inventory.",122
Cody Acree, Analyst, Great. Thanks.,123
Operator,Operator, Your final question comes from Ben Lynch from Deutsche Bank. ,124
Ben Lynch, Analyst," Lucky me. Sorry. I feel like I might be flogging a dead horse on this, but I'm going to come back to it. The Q4 revenues beat your initial expectations in the end by about 7 to 8% which actually corresponds to the extra week which you're having in Q1, with the Q1 seasonality. It seems like you have this extra week benefiting Q4 instead of Q1, and I'm trying to understand, is this just conservatism, did you get some extra business in Q4, or help me understand that and I have a follow-up please.",125
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," This is going to be hard for me to help you understand. In the Fourth Quarter, what we think we saw was just good solid demand. As Paul said, people took the parts and did something with them and did their business. In the First Quarter, there is an extra week we've been through this extra week a couple of times and in our past experience you can never quantify exactly what you get. And I typically won't make an entire week worth of sales. I'll say it is something less. It's just an estimate. So it's really hard to be able to tell you precisely what you get for the extra week. Am I being a little cautious? Maybe, but I don't think so. Again, 12% year-over-year is good solid growth in the First Quarter. Q4 was a very good quarter. I'm comfortable starting with a midpoint of 9.1, and I'd be delighted to be able to come back and say I was low again.",126
Ben Lynch, Analyst," Okay. Great. Just the follow-up--I just want to make sure I understand again the start-up costs. You're seeing in the first half in cogs and therefore presumably you'll see it back in OPEX in the second half. So does this mean we're going to have sort of a much bigger second half R&D than we do in the first half? And related to that, is the OPEX guidance for Q1 on a 14 week basis and it will drop off in the Second Quarter?",127
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP"," The OPEX we guide to includes a 14-week, in that--in the outlook and it would drop back off. Keep in mind also the annual rate is to take place on the first of April so you get a little bit of up tick to that in the Second Quarter, so as you do your models. Your other question was about when we start to see the start-up costs roll off? You're getting into a pretty technical space. It won't transition back to R&D. What those factories will do once they're qualified to build products on 65nm process is they will begin to build products eligible for sale that actually turns into cost of sales associated with a product that is recognized as expense when the product is shipped for revenue. So it doesn't go to R&D. It actually goes into manufacturing production.",128
Ben Lynch, Analyst," Okay, so we're just talking about, once at start-up costs you see it in the quarter that you incur that cost and once it goes into product you see it whenever that product is sold out of inventory.",129
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP","  Some of that. But also recognize that some of it doesn't repeat. For example, one of the things you do when you're starting up a factory or getting the process ready is you do test wafers. Those are wafers you run to make sure the process works and doesn't go away. We won't run a bunch of product to throw away. We won't waste that material. So you don't see 100% of the cost go into cost of sales. What you see is some fraction of that cost.",130
Ben Lynch, Analyst," Right. Okay, thanks very much for that explanation, Andy.",131
Andy Bryant," Chief Financial and Enterprise Services Officer,  EVP", Sure.,132
Doug Lusk, Director of Investor Relations," Okay. We'd like to thank everyone for listening to today's call. A recorded playback of this call will be available at approximately 5:00 p.m. Pacific Time tonight. Those interested should dial 1-800-642-1687, and reference pass code 3037058. Thank you. And good night.",133
